# Plant Health System

The **Plant Health System** is a Spring Boot web application that allows users to register, log in, and identify plants through a third-party plant identification API.

- **User Authentication**: Enables secure login and logout for users.
- **Profile Page**: Displays logged-in user details.
- **Plant Identification**: Allows users to identify plants by sending data to a third-party API.
- **Home Page**: A welcoming page for users and visitors.
- **Secure Logout**: Provides secure logout functionality, clearing session data.

## Technologies Used
